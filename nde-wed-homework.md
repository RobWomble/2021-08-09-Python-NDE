2. Create a function that will accept two strings. Have the function return a single string after having the two strings inputted combined around the phrase "the last time I was in a porta-potty".

3. Create a function that will accept a list of integers AS AN ARGUMENT that will then grade each integer like a test (A > 90, B > 80 ...). Count the number of A's, B's, C's, D's, and F's, then return a dictionary in the format:    {"A": 3, "B": 7, ... }

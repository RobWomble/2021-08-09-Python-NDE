# Weekend Homework

1. Spend at least 15 minutes clarifying what you want your project to do, and how you want to try to accomplish these steps.

2. Write out the pseudo-code (comments on what you want your code to do) for your project. Then try to group the pseudo-code into smaller units which we will try to turn into functions.
 
3. Create at least 3 `test_` functions that use an **assert** statement, which will help you test that a specific portion of your code will work. You may want to start with pseudo-code for this assignment as well.

4. Choose the **Self-Study Opportunities** lab that you think you could use for your project and do it. 

5. From the lab titled **Using Classes**, edit the file `dice_contest.py` to use 3 functions instead of 1.
